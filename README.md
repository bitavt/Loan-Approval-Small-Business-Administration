Should This Loan be Approved or Denied?

The dataset comes from the real dataset from U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) with 899164 rows and 27 columns.

The U.S. SBA was founded in 1953. Its mission is to promote
and assist small enterprises in the U.S. credit market due to their essential role in job
creation and reducing unemployment in the United States. SBA provides a loan guarantee
program which is designed to encourage banks to grant loans
to small businesses. In other words, SBA covers a portion of the loan they
guaranteed if the loan goes into default, and consequencly reduces the risk for a bank.
FedEx and Apple Computer in their early stage received SBA loan guarantees.
